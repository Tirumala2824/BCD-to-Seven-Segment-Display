# BCD-to-Seven-Segment-Display
To display roll no. on Seven segment display

1) State the problem
2) Identify the number of inputs and
outputs then assign the different
variables for inputs and outputs

3) Construct the truth table which
indicates the Relationship between
inputs and outputs
4) Obtain the simplified output logic
Expressions using K-map
5) Design the simplified output logic
Expression only using 2 inputs of AND
gate, OR gate and also using one input
and one output gate NOT gate, then
build the logic circuits for the above
Expressions using suitable ICâ€™s and
Seven-Segment
6) Apply the various combination of
inputs according to the truth table and
observe the condition of output
